Blockchain Simulation
This project is a blockchain simulation built using React and JavaScript. It simulates the functionality of a blockchain system and visualizes blockchain operations such as block mining, block generation, and chain validation. The frontend is developed using React and styled with Tailwind CSS, offering a simple yet interactive user interface.

Features
Blockchain Simulation: Simulates blockchain blocks and their transactions.
Block Mining: Adds mining functionality to the blockchain, allowing for blocks to be mined and added to the chain.
Block Visualization: Visualizes blocks and transactions on the frontend.
React-based UI: Utilizes React to manage the user interface with various components like Navbar, MainPage, Blocks, and Buttons.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the components, ensuring responsive and modern design.
Technologies Used
Frontend:
React.js
Tailwind CSS
Blockchain:
JavaScript
Node.js (for backend simulation if needed)
Others:
Vite (for fast project setup and development)
Git (version control)
